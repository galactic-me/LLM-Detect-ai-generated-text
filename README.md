# LLM-Detect-ai-generated-text
ML Model based on Classification and pre-trained models such as Bert , GPT-3 to detect AI generated text
With the advent of LLMs such as Chat GPT, Bard it has become significantly easy
to plagiarize texts,spread false information and they have the ability to
effectively replicate human speech. Therefore, to maintain ingenuity, it becomes
important to detect LLM generated text.
For this we have multiple approaches. The approaches discussed are:
(1) Traditional Classification Algorithms
(2) Deep Learning approaches
Black Box Detection Methods and  White Box Detection Methods
What Are Some Metrics used by AI Content Detection Tools?
(1) Perplexity: It is a measure of newness of text to the model. Higher perplexity means
the text is generated by LLM. Lower perplexity means that the text has been generated by
student.
BURSTINESS:Burstiness refersto the distribution of topics or ideas within a piece of
content. It measures how frequently certain topics or ideas appear in a short span of time.
A bursty content has frequent occurrences of certain topics, resulting in a non-uniform
distribution.
